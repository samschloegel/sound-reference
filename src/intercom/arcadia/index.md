# Clear-Com ARCADIA

::: info A note about ARCADIA

ARCADIA is now the replacement product for the Main Station of legacy HelixNet systems (HMS-4X). It is a main station unit that combines HelixNet and FreeSpeak systems into one, and adds additional features such as Dante connectivity. In an ARADIA system, the ARCADIA base station replaces both the HelixNet HMS-4X and the FreeSpeak FSII-BASE-II.

The general system setup principles of legacy HelixNet and FreeSpeak systems still apply to ARCADIA, but many of the physical connectivity tasks are simplified by having a single fully-integrated unit.
