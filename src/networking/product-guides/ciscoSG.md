# Cisco SG Series

## SG Series Model Numbers

The SGxxx series' of switches have similarly-structured model numbers. Some common models:

- SG300-20
- SG350-28
- SG350-28MP
- SG350X-24P

The model numbers are structured as follows:
SG[`AAAA`]-[`##`][`P`/`MP`]

- `AAAA`: Series (300, 350, 350X...) related to release date and support timeline. The X in 350X indicates 10Gbit trunk ports / stacking capability.

- `##`: The port count (i.e. SG350-28 has 28 ports - though it's important to check whether they are all Gigabit Ethernet vs SFP or Combo type).

- `P`/`MP`: Indicates total PoE power budget. For example, -28 (no PoE) / -28P (195W) / -28MP (382W)
