## CBS Series Model Numbers

The SGxxx series' of switches have similarly-structured model numbers. Some common models:

- CBS350-28T-4G
- CBS350-28FP-4G
- CBS350-28FP-4X

The model numbers are structured as follows:
CBS350-[`AA`][`BB`]-[`C`][`D`]

- `AA` - General access port count - `8` / `24` / etc.

- `BB` - PoE supply - `T` (no PoE) / `P` (low PoE budget) / `FP` (high PoE budget)

- `CC` - Trunk port count - `2` / `4` / etc - check specs for port type (GE/SFP/SFP+)

- `DD` - Trunk port type - `G` (1Gbit) / `X` (10Gbit)
