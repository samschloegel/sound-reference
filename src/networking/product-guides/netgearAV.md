# NETGEAR AV Line

## M4250 Series

Having mostly come from the Cisco SG and CBS side, I have begrudgingly started using the AV GUI on the M4250 Series switches. To my surprise, it is actually more usable than it feels.

- Turn off Auto Trunk!
- Turn off Auto LAG!

I have used the basic "Data" profile for Control, Intercom, KVM, and other VLANs. So far it hasn't caused any problems.

I have used the Audio Dante profile for Dante Primary and Dante Secondary VLANs, also so far without any problems.
